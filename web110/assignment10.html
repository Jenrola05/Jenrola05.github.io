    <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a pivotal technology in web development, serving as a style sheet language designed for describing the presentation of documents written in markup languages. Its primary objective is to separate the presentation from the content, offering control over layout, colors, and fonts.</p>

    <p>One of the key advantages of CSS is its ability to enhance content accessibility and provide flexibility and control over presentation characteristics. It enables the sharing of common formatting across multiple HTML pages, reducing complexity and repetition in structural content. CSS allows for presenting the same markup page in different styles for various rendering methods and adjusting the display based on screen size or viewing device</p>

    <p>The CSS specification incorporates a priority scheme to determine the application of style rules when multiple rules match a particular element. These specifications are meticulously maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring standardization and compatibility across different platforms.</p>

    <P>A CSS style sheet consists of rules, each comprising selectors and a declaration block. Selectors identify which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes. Classes and IDs, being case-sensitive and adhering to specific naming conventions, play a crucial role in targeting elements.</P>

    <p>The declaration block within a rule encompasses property-value pairs, with values being keywords or numerical values. CSS supports three modes of specification: inline, internal, and external. Inline CSS is applied directly to HTML elements, while internal CSS is defined within the style tags in the document head. External CSS is linked through a link element, referencing an external style sheet file.</p>

    <p>Key properties include 'margin' (space around an element) and 'padding' (spacing between content and border). These properties enable precise control over the layout, allowing adjustments to the distance between elements. Commenting is supported within style sheets to enhance code readability.</p>

    <p>CSS introduces essential terms such as 'class,' 'declaration,' 'Font-Family,' 'id,' 'ID Selectors,' 'inherit,' 'initial,' 'margin,' 'padding,' 'property,' 'rule,' 'selector,' 'unset,' and 'value.' Each term carries specific meanings, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of CSS.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, CSS empowers developers to create visually appealing and responsive web pages by separating presentation concerns from content. Its versatility, standardization, and wide-ranging capabilities make it an indispensable tool for crafting modern and accessible web interfaces.
