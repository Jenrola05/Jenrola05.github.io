                                           Computer Networking
  A computer network is a digital telecommunications infrastructure enabling data exchange between connected devices through wired or wireless media. Data is transmitted in formatted units called packets, which are reassembled at their destination. Wired media includes coaxial, twisted-pair cables, and optical fiber, while wireless local area networks use Wi-Fi technology.

Network components include Network Interface Controllers (NICs) for accessing transmission media, each with a unique MAC address in Ethernet networks. Repeaters or hubs clean and regenerate network signals, with switches replacing hubs in local area networks. Bridges or switches connect and filter multiple segments or devices based on MAC addresses, routers forward data packets between networks using IP addresses, and modems connect nodes via modulated signals.

Firewalls control network security, allowing or rejecting access requests based on recognition. Network topology defines the layout of interconnected nodes, such as bus, star, ring, and mesh configurations. Communications protocols, organized in stacks, facilitate information exchange over a network. HTTP over TCP over IP over IEEE 802.11 exemplifies a protocol stack.

The Internet employs hundreds of standardized protocols within the Internet Protocol Suite, administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. Networks are categorized by physical capacity or organizational purpose, including Personal Area Networks (PANs), Local Area Networks (LANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs). Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) overlay networks using virtual circuits, while intranets are controlled by a single entity, and extranets support limited connections to external networks.

Routing selects network paths for traffic, and network services are applications hosted on servers for users or network operation. Network security involves provisions and policies to prevent unauthorized access or misuse. The Internet Protocol Suite comprises four layers: Link, Internet, Transport, and Application, maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

The Link layer handles local network communication, the Internet layer connects networks, the Transport layer manages host-to-host communication, and the Application layer deals with specific data communication services. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names to IP addresses, delegating authority over domains to name servers.

The DNS utilizes a tree data structure, with nodes having labels and resource records. The domain name space starts at the root zone, subdividing into zones, and the right-most label signifies the top-level domain. Key terms include 4G (fourth-gen mobile technology), addresses, network backbone, bandwidth, clients, DARPA (U.S. Defense agency), domain names, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), frames, FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name), gateways, hosts, IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), IP (Internet Protocol), ISPs (Internet Service Providers), packets, protocols, proxy servers, servers, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), TLDs (Top-Level Domains), and throughput.

In summary, computer networks enable data exchange through wired or wireless connections. Components like NICs, routers, and firewalls manage network functions. Protocols and protocol stacks govern communication, and the Internet Protocol Suite organizes communication layers. Network security, topology, and services contribute to effective network operation.
     In my knowledge, after reading about networking, i now have more ideas about how computer works within each other how wired and wireless media transfer data between each other and its going to help me alot for future purpose
