                                    Internet Security
  Internet security is a critical aspect of computer security that focuses on protecting data and systems connected to the Internet. It encompasses measures to safeguard against various cyber threats, including malware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, and unauthorized access. The goal is to establish rules and countermeasures to mitigate the risks associated with online activities.

Cyber Threats and Risks:

The Internet is susceptible to numerous threats, such as phishing, viruses, trojans, worms, and more. Users may unwittingly download malicious software, leading to disruption, data breaches, or unauthorized access. Malware, which includes viruses, trojans, and spyware, is designed to compromise computer systems and gather sensitive information.

Specific Cyber Threats:

Botnets: Networks of compromised computers, controlled by a single entity, perform large-scale malicious acts.
Ransomware: Restricts access to a computer system and demands a ransom for removal of the restriction.
Scareware: Deceptive software sold through unethical marketing, causing fear or anxiety in users.
Spyware: Monitors and reports computer activity without user consent.
Trojan Horse: Malicious software disguised as harmless, tricking users into downloading it.
Keylogging: Records keystrokes on a keyboard without user knowledge.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: Attempts to make a computer resource unavailable to users.
Security Measures and Technologies:

Cryptographic Methods: Secure data transmission using protocols like SSL/TLS, PGP, and IPsec.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enhances access control by requiring multiple authentication factors.
Firewalls: Control network access, screening and blocking dangerous traffic.
Antivirus Software: Detects and eliminates viruses, enhancing device security.
Password Managers: Safely store and organize complex passwords for various accounts.
Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII):

PII/SPI Definition: Personally identifiable information or sensitive personal information that can identify an individual.
Ethical Codes: Adopted by organizations to guide ethical decision-making, encompassing business ethics, employee conduct, and professional practice.
 Iplan on applying internet security to myself and the public by creating awareness through Education by letting people know about the potential risks associated with posting some of their sensitive and personal stuff on the internet.
