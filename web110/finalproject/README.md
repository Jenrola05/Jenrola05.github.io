## Final Project - WEB 250

This project extends the WEB 200 pizza ordering application by implementing server-side features using Python and Flask. The final application supports customer and staff login, pizza order placement, tax calculation via REST API, and order management. The backend uses SQLite and is containerized with Docker for deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

I learned how to build robust server-side applications using Flask, manage data with SQLAlchemy, and ensure proper user authentication and session handling. I plan to apply these skills to build small business applications and pursue web development opportunities in my career.
