    <h1>Visual Studio Code (VS Code</h1>

    <p>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a versatile and widely-used source-code editor developed by Microsoft, designed to be compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS. It has gained immense popularity among developers due to its rich feature set and flexibility.</p>

    <p>Released in April 2015 and officially launched in April 2016, Visual Studio Code has become a cornerstone in the development environment, recognized in the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey as the most popular tool among 86,544 respondents, with a significant 73.71% reporting its usage. Interestingly, it's more favored by those learning to code than by professional developers, with 78% of learners compared to 74% of professionals using it.</p>

    <p>Visual Studio Code is language-agnostic, supporting a plethora of programming languages, including C, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and more. It is based on the Electron framework and utilizes the "Monaco" editor component also employed in Azure DevOps.</p>

    <p>Its features encompass syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging support for Node.js, and IntelliSense for several languages out of the box. The editor's versatility extends to source control, where users can access version control settings and manage changes within the dedicated tab. Notably, it supports Git, Apache Subversion, Perforce, and other version control systems.</p>

    <p>One distinctive aspect of Visual Studio Code is its extension system, offering a centralized repository for various extensions, including language support and additional editor features. Users can customize their experience by adding extensions that support new languages, themes, debuggers, and even perform static code analysis.

    </p>

    <p>In addition to its primary use as a code editor, Visual Studio Code supports FTP extensions for web development, enabling users to sync code between the editor and a server seamlessly.</p>

    <p>However, it's important to note that Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft, although users have the option to disable this feature. Despite being open source, some telemetry functionality is added before release under a proprietary license.</p>

    <p>The history of Visual Studio Code traces back to its announcement at the 2015 Build conference, followed by a preview build release. The source code was later open-sourced under the MIT License on November 18, 2015, and made available on GitHub, marking the beginning of extensive community contributions. Microsoft released most of the source code under the MIT License, while binary releases by Microsoft include proprietary code.</p>

    <p>Overall, Visual Studio Code stands out as a powerful, cross-platform code editor, favored for its extensive feature set, flexibility, and support for a wide range of programming languages, making it a go-to choice for developers worldwide</p>
